# Attention sink
**Type:** Construct  
**Referenced in:** 4 papers  

## State of the Field

The concept of an "attention sink" is consistently described across the provided literature as a phenomenon in Transformer models where attention is disproportionately focused on initial tokens. The prevailing definition states that a large portion of attention weights concentrates on "the first token," a process that begins in the early layers of the model. A related framing describes this as "initial tokens" more broadly absorbing attention, which is said to impede "subsequent tokens from attending to relevant context" ("EPIC: Efficient Position-Independent Caching for Serving Large Language Models"). This phenomenon is operationalized by observing the distribution of attention weights within the model. The attention sink is presented as a problem to be addressed, with one paper discussing the "removal" of these tokens to prevent interference in later computations. In the context of model capabilities, the attention sink is reported to negatively affect length generalization, where it is cited as a factor that "restricts their scalability and effectiveness in practice" for training-free extrapolation methods ("ParallelComp: Parallel Long-Context Compressor for Length Extrapolation").
