# Semantic similarity
**Type:** Construct  
**Referenced in:** 5 papers  
**Also known as:** LLM-oriented semantic similarity  

## State of the Field

Across the provided literature, semantic similarity is a construct concerning the degree to which the meaning between two pieces of text aligns. The concept is applied in several contexts, including comparing generated text to a reference, evaluating a perturbed token against its original version, and assessing the alignment between a demonstration and a test problem for in-context learning. One paper introduces a specialized variant, "LLM-oriented semantic similarity," which is defined relative to the specific encoding parameters of an inference model. The construct is most frequently operationalized using measures based on contextual embeddings; for example, one paper notes that "BERTScore... computes semantic similarity by comparing contextual embeddings," while another uses token embedding distance. A different approach is also documented, where the "Rouge-L F1 score... serves as an indicator of sentence-level semantic similarity."
