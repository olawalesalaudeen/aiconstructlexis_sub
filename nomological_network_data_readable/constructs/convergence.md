## State of the Field

Across the provided literature, convergence is most commonly defined as the tendency of a training or optimization process to stabilize toward a good solution over iterations. Some papers offer more technical definitions, framing it as an optimization algorithm's property of approaching a stationary point where the gradient is zero, or a minimum of the loss function. The construct is operationalized primarily through theoretical analysis and empirical comparison of different optimization methods and model components. For instance, researchers establish "rigorous convergence guarantees" for specific optimizers like AdamS and GoLore, with one paper noting that GoLore "provably converges to stationary solutions at a rate of O(1/√T)" ("Subspace Optimization for Large Language Models with Convergence Guarantees"). Other work proves that certain training techniques, such as specific weight pruning methods, exhibit convergence properties. The concept is also used for empirical comparisons, as one study shows "that the convergence rate of low-rank adapters surpasses that of sparse weights" ("SLoPe: Double-Pruned Sparse Plus Lazy Low-Rank Adapter Pretraining of LLMs"). Finally, convergence is also studied in relation to instruction fine-tuning.
