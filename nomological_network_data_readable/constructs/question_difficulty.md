## State of the Field

The concept of question difficulty is broadly used to describe the inherent challenge a query or data point presents to a language model, though definitions vary on whether this is an intrinsic property of the data or relative to a model's capabilities. A prevalent view treats difficulty as model-dependent, where it is inversely correlated with a model's performance or represents a model's internal perception of task complexity inferred from failure rates. In contrast, a less common framing defines it as a latent trait of a question, independent of any single model and instead relative to a population of models, referred to as an 'item parameter' ("Reliable and Efficient Amortized Model-based Evaluation"). A distinct line of work focuses specifically on the difficulty of preference data for alignment, defining it as the challenge in distinguishing between preferred and rejected responses. Across these framings, the construct is most frequently operationalized through model performance metrics, such as validation loss or the distribution of failure probabilities. Other measurement approaches use proxies, such as the complexity of generated code for a task or CLIP-based similarity scores for preference pairs. In the provided literature, question difficulty is reported to influence human preference alignment and is studied alongside the general capabilities of models. Researchers use this construct to inform methods for adaptive compute allocation and to guide the selection of training samples for fine-tuning algorithms.
