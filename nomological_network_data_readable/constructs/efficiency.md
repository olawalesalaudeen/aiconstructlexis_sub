# Efficiency
**Type:** Construct  
**Referenced in:** 27 papers  
**Also known as:** Cost-efficiency, Efficient learning, Optimality  

## State of the Field

Across the surveyed literature, the prevailing usage of efficiency refers to the property of achieving strong performance while reducing computational or memory costs during training and inference. Papers operationalize this construct by measuring a range of metrics, including inference time, GFLOPs, the number of trainable parameters, memory usage, and data or API call costs. For example, one study notes its approach is "2x faster and 1.8x cheaper" ("Generating Complex Question Decompositions in the Face of Distribution Shifts"), while another focuses on minimizing "training time and data costs" for model editing ("BalancEdit: Dynamically Balancing the Generality-Locality Trade-off in Multi-modal Model Editing"). The provided data also indicates that `LLM-based evaluation` is used as a measurement instrument for efficiency. A smaller line of work presents more specialized framings. One paper introduces "Cost-efficiency" to explicitly link system performance to monetary cost. Another defines "Efficient learning" as an agent's capacity for "rapid learning from a small amount of data" ("Agent Workflow Memory"). A third perspective, "Optimality," considers efficiency as part of achieving the "most efficient solutions" ("Position: We Need An Algorithmic Understanding of Generative AI"). The construct of efficiency is also studied in relation to `Safety`.
