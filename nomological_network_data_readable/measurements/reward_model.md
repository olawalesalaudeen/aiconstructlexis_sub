## State of the Field

Across the provided literature, a reward model is most commonly defined as a learned scoring procedure used to assess how well a response aligns with a query, often for the purpose of filtering or ranking candidate responses. Its primary function is to compute a score that, as one paper states, "reflects how well the response Y aligns with given query X" ("Beyond Imitation: Leveraging Fine-grained Quality Signals for Alignment"). The provided papers use this instrument to measure constructs such as `Human preference alignment`, `Faithfulness`, and `Proactivity`. The development of these models is frequently based on human preferences, and is shown to be related to both `LLM-as-a-judge` and `Human evaluation` methodologies. Specific implementations mentioned in the data include the "Open-Assistant model (DeBERTa-v3)", "RM-Gemma-2B", and "RM-Mistral-7B". A less common framing appears in one paper, which introduces a "process reward model (PRM)" designed to evaluate the quality of intermediate reasoning steps, or "thoughts," rather than only the final output. Other documented applications include its use as a "model-based reference-less metric" and for evaluating the solvability of sub-tasks in planning frameworks.
