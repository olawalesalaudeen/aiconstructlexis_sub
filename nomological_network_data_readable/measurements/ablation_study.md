## State of the Field

Across the surveyed literature, an ablation study is consistently described as an experimental procedure for evaluating the contribution of a system's components to its overall performance. The most common operationalization involves systematically removing or disabling parts of a model, algorithm, or framework and measuring the resulting change in performance. The explicit goal is to "isolate and measure their contribution" ("Decision Tree Induction Through LLMs via Semantically-Aware Evolution") or "validate the effectiveness of each component" ("Hephaestus..."). The components targeted for ablation are diverse, including algorithmic elements, parts of prompts, reasoning stages like self-reflection, and specific agents within a multi-agent system. A smaller set of papers uses the term "ablation analysis" to refer to a more specific application of this method, such as disconnecting attention connections to test their role in a model's internal circuits. The typical outcome reported is that removing a component "leads to a noticeable decline in performance" ("WebQuality..."), thereby demonstrating its utility. As a measurement procedure, ablation studies are used to assess the impact of specific constructs, such as Self-reflection, and to evaluate how different model layers affect performance on tasks like Authorship attribution.
