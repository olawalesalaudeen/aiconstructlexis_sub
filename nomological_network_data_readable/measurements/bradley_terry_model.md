# Bradley-Terry model
**Type:** Measurement  
**Referenced in:** 8 papers  
**Also known as:** Bradley-Terry regression  

## State of the Field

The Bradley-Terry model is consistently described across the provided literature as a statistical method for analyzing pairwise comparisons to estimate relative performance. Its prevailing use is to aggregate preference data to produce rankings, with one paper calling it "the canonical model for assessing relative performance of models based on pairwise comparisons" (AutoEval Done Right: Using Synthetic Data for Model Evaluation). Papers operationalize this in several ways: some use it to aggregate comparisons to "form a leaderboard over LLMs" (Prompt-to-Leaderboard: Prompt-Adaptive LLM Evaluations), while others use it to estimate preference probabilities or simulate annotation noise. In terms of what it evaluates, the model is used to measure the construct of `Faithfulness`. It is also studied in relation to `Preference prediction`. While most sources refer to it as the "Bradley-Terry model," a related framing is "Bradley-Terry regression," which specifically emphasizes its use in aggregating human preference votes to estimate model strength parameters.
