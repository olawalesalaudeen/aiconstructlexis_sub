# MATH10K
**Type:** Measurement  
**Referenced in:** 10 papers  
**Also known as:** Math10K, MATH-10K  

## State of the Field

Across the provided literature, MATH10K is consistently characterized as a dataset used to fine-tune large language models for arithmetic reasoning. It is widely used to operationalize and assess the construct of 'Mathematical reasoning', with papers specifically referencing 'arithmetic reasoning' and 'math problem-solving'. The dataset is defined as containing 'math word problems' and is described in some sources as a 'composite dataset' that combines multiple benchmarks. For instance, one paper notes it includes GSM8K, MAWPS, and SVAMP, while another states it comprises 'seven arithmetic reasoning tasks'. The prevailing usage pattern involves fine-tuning a model on MATH10K before assessing its performance on separate, downstream math benchmarks. While its primary role is for fine-tuning, one paper also suggests it can be used for evaluation. Overall, the data presents MATH10K as a resource for training models on mathematical tasks, rather than as a direct evaluation benchmark itself.
