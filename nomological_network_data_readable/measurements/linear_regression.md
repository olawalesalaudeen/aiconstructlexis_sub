**Also known as:** Linear Regression  

## State of the Field

Across the provided literature, 'Linear regression' refers to several distinct applications rather than a single, unified concept. The most prevalent usage frames it as an observable behavior or task for studying in-context learning (ICL), where a model must infer a linear function from a series of prompt examples and apply it to a new input. One paper notes a line of research that specifically studies ICL by pretraining models on this task with a Gaussian prior. A different application treats linear regression as a similarity index for comparing the weight matrices of different transformer layers, though one study notes that as an index it can fail to "exhibit clear structural patterns" and its heatmaps may appear "noisy." A third use is as a regression procedure within a model, specifically to predict target values from data-mixture weights using a linear model with L2 regularization, also known as ridge regression.
