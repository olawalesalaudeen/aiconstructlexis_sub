## State of the Field

Across the provided literature, scaling laws are predominantly characterized as a family of parametric, often power-law, models used to predict language model performance—typically cross-entropy loss—by extrapolating from smaller-scale experiments. The most common formulation, seen in widely referenced baselines like the Chinchilla, OpenAI, and Kaplan scaling laws, models loss as a function of model size (parameter count) and data size (training tokens). The primary application is to forecast the performance of larger models, as one paper frames the task as predicting the "optimal tradeoff...for a large model...by extrapolating from smaller-scale experiments" ("RE-Bench..."). Beyond this general usage, a number of papers propose specialized laws for specific contexts: the "Distillation Scaling Law" incorporates teacher model performance, the "Capybara scaling law" adds parameters for floating-point quantization, and the "P2 law" predicts loss after model pruning. Other work extends the concept to data composition, with the "D-CPT law" providing a framework to find optimal data mixture ratios for domain adaptation. These laws are frequently used as baselines for comparison, as one study notes it "used [the Chinchilla scaling law] as the basis for exploring our proposed float precision scaling law" ("Scaling Laws for Floating–Point Quantization Training"). A less common usage frames the concept not as a model but as a benchmark task, the "Scaling Law Experiment," which evaluates an agent's ability to apply these principles. The concept is also studied in relation to scalability.
