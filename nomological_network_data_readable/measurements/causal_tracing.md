## State of the Field

The prevailing usage of Causal tracing in the provided literature is as a technique to measure the influence of intermediate model states on final outputs. Its operationalization is consistent across papers, involving a comparison between a "clean run" and a "corrupted run" where inputs are perturbed, typically by adding noise to tokens. Researchers then selectively restore the activations of specific components, such as MLP or attention layers, from the clean run and measure the resulting change in the model's predictions. This method is frequently applied to identify which parts of a model's computation are responsible for a given behavior. For instance, several papers use it to locate the specific modules or layers responsible for recalling factual knowledge. Other documented applications include identifying components that "mediate bias," locating tokens critical for repetition avoidance, and tracing information flow to understand specificity failures. A less common application mentioned is its use in analyzing the mechanisms behind grammatical acceptability judgment. One paper offers a narrower definition, framing it specifically as a procedure for identifying modules that recall facts, which reflects one of its most common uses.
