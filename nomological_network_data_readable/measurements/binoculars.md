**Also known as:** Binocular  

## State of the Field

Across the provided literature, Binoculars is consistently characterized as a tool for detecting AI-generated text. The prevailing description of its mechanism is that it leverages distributional differences between human and machine writing, often operationalized through likelihood or log probability comparisons. A more specific framing, present in a subset of the data, states that it identifies AI content by comparing the log probabilities of an original text to a perturbed version, as one paper notes it "employ[s] perturbation as a comparison to the original text and rely on the log probability to detect." It is also described as an open-source and zero-shot detector, which allows it to function without labeled training data. In research practice, Binoculars is used as a baseline automatic detector and is evaluated as part of a "suite of prominent detectors." One study observes that it can "struggle" in certain contexts. The name appears as both "Binoculars" and "Binocular" across different papers.
