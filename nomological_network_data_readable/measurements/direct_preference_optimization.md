# Direct Preference Optimization
**Type:** Measurement  
**Referenced in:** 5 papers  
**Also known as:** Direct preference optimization, DPO  

## State of the Field

Across the provided literature, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is consistently characterized as a fine-tuning method or algorithm for aligning language models with preference data. A recurring point across definitions is that it operates by comparing preferred and dispreferred responses without an explicit reward modeling step. One paper frames it as an alternative to RLHF that "implicitly optimizes the same objective as RLHF but offers higher stability" (GLiREL- Generalist Model for Zero-Shot Relation Extraction). The method is applied to a range of different goals across the surveyed work. For instance, some research uses DPO to "refine the reasoning capabilities" of models (Hephaestus: Improving Fundamental Agent Capabilities of Large Language Models through Continual Pre-Training). Other work employs it to shift model behavior toward moral or immoral actions, serving as a test of alignment robustness. It is also mentioned as a method for training community-personalized models.
