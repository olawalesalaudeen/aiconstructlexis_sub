**Also known as:** Majority Voting  

## State of the Field

The dominant usage of Majority voting in the provided literature is as an evaluation heuristic or baseline method for selecting a final answer from multiple model-generated solutions. This procedure involves generating several candidate answers for a problem and choosing the one that occurs most frequently, as one paper describes: 'one can sample many proposed solutions, extract the final answer from each, and select the most common answer' (Don't Trust: Verify -- Grounding LLM Quantitative Reasoning with Autoformalization). It is frequently used as a point of comparison and is referred to as a 'strong baseline' in some work. A smaller set of studies uses the term differently, to describe an aggregation method where multiple review models vote for the better of two responses. In its more common form, Majority voting is explicitly equated with 'Self-Consistency Decoding' and is noted as being applicable to Chain-of-thought reasoning. The method is also categorized as a 'test-time compute scaling procedure' and is studied alongside other selection heuristics like Best-of-N.
