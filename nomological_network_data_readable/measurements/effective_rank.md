## State of the Field

Across the provided literature, 'Effective rank' is a computational metric with two distinct applications for analyzing model internals. One line of work presents it as a specific variant of 'Effective state-size' (ESS), a metric used to measure `Context utilization`. In this framing, 'Effective rank' is synonymous with 'Entropy-ESS' and is computed from the spectral entropy of a linear operator's singular values. The broader ESS metric is explicitly proposed as a 'proxy for memory utilization' in causal sequence models. A separate application uses 'Effective rank' to assess `Reward overoptimization` by measuring the diversity of hidden state representations in reward models. This approach operationalizes the detection of overfitting by comparing the metric's value on training versus evaluation data. As one study notes, a 'large discrepancy between the erank of the train and evaluation sets indicates that the model... [has] overfitted.' Thus, the metric is used to operationalize both `Context utilization` and `Reward overoptimization` through related but distinct computational procedures.
