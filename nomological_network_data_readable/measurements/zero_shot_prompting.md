## State of the Field

Across the provided literature, Zero-shot prompting is consistently characterized as an evaluation protocol or procedure. The prevailing definition across multiple papers is that it involves providing a model with a task description or instruction without any prior examples or demonstrations. Several sources also specify that this method is used without any task-specific fine-tuning, aiming to assess a model's out-of-the-box capabilities. The stated purpose is to test a model's ability to follow instructions and generalize, as one paper notes it "relies solely on the pre-trained knowledge and generalization abilities of LLMs" (Mitigating Tail Narrowing inLLMSelf-Improvement via Socratic-Guided Sampling). In practice, it is frequently employed as a baseline method for comparison. Researchers contrast its performance with other approaches such as fine-tuning, few-shot prompting, and chain-of-thought prompting. This protocol is used to measure specific behaviors; for instance, it is used to benchmark models on "Native language identification".
