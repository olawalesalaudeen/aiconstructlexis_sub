## State of the Field

Across the provided literature, the Tuned lens is predominantly characterized as an interpretability tool for inspecting and decoding model activations at different layers to understand the information they represent. Its operational mechanism is consistently defined as a layerwise affine transformation. This procedure projects hidden states from a given layer into the output vocabulary space, with one paper specifying that the transformation is learned "from the output space of layer ℓ to the output space of the final layer" ("Residual Stream Analysis with Multi-Layer SAEs"). The stated purpose of this transformation is to map activations into a "more comparable basis," thereby enhancing interpretability and precision. Researchers employ the Tuned lens to achieve a "layer-by-layer understanding of how each token’s role and meaning are progressively sculpted" ("How Much Do Encoder Models Know About Word Senses?"). It is also used for more targeted inspection, such as identifying specific vectors within a model's representations.
