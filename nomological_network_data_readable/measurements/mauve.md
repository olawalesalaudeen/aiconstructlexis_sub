## State of the Field

Across the provided literature, MAUVE is consistently used as an automatic metric to evaluate text generation by comparing the distribution of machine-generated text to that of human-written or reference text. The most prevalent definition describes it as a non-parametric method that compares embedding distributions using a mixture of forward and reverse KL divergences. A few papers provide a more specific mechanism, stating that it calculates the "area under the KL divergence curve" to measure this similarity. The primary application of MAUVE is to assess the "distributional similarity" between generated and ground-truth text, which is often framed as a measure of overall generation quality. The relationships data confirms its use for evaluating both general "Text generation" and "Conditional text generation". In addition to this general use, some studies employ MAUVE to quantify more specific attributes, such as "fluency" or "style consistency" between training data and model outputs.
