## State of the Field

Across the provided literature, MetaMathQA is most commonly described as a benchmark for math-oriented tasks, used for both instruction tuning and evaluation. As a measurement instrument, it is explicitly used to evaluate text generation, with papers employing it to assess capabilities like mathematical question answering and reasoning-chain evaluation. Several papers also utilize it as a dataset for model training, for instance, by fine-tuning models on arithmetic reasoning tasks. This dual role is captured by the most prevalent definition, which frames it as a "federated natural language generation benchmark used for math-oriented instruction tuning and evaluation." One study further specifies its application in a federated context, noting that the dataset is partitioned in an IID manner for experiments. In summary, the provided sources consistently position MetaMathQA as a resource for both developing and assessing model performance on mathematical reasoning.
