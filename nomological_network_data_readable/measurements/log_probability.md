## State of the Field

Across the provided literature, log probability is a versatile metric used to probe different aspects of language model behavior, primarily focusing on authorship attribution and bias. One line of work operationalizes log probability as a training-free method for detecting AI-generated text, treating it as a "statistical indicator of AI authorship" based on the tendency of models to generate high-probability tokens ("Spontaneous Giving and Calculated Greed in Language Models"). A more common application in this set of papers is the measurement of model bias, where the probability assigned to specific tokens reveals underlying model expectations. For instance, "Token probability" is defined as a measure of the likelihoods for gendered tokens like 'he' and 'she' to capture "fine-grained, probabilistic bias" ("Invisible Entropy: Towards Safe and Efficient Low-EntropyLLMWatermarking"). Similarly, a related concept called "Surprisal," defined as the negative log probability, is used to measure how strongly a model expects a particular user demographic based on the probability of a demographic attribute value following a prompt ("ML-Promise: A Multilingual Dataset for Corporate Promise Verification"). While the underlying calculation of model-assigned token likelihood is consistent, its application varies, being framed as a detector for AI authorship in one context and as a tool for uncovering implicit gender and demographic biases in others.
