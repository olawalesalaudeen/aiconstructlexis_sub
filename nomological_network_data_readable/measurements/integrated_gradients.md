## State of the Field

Across the provided literature, Integrated Gradients is consistently defined as a gradient-based attribution method used to determine the importance of input features for a model's prediction. The common operational definition involves calculating this importance by integrating or accumulating gradients along a path from a baseline input to the actual input. It is frequently employed as a model-dependent interpretability tool, for example, to identify words that contribute most to a text classification. Several papers use it as a baseline for comparison, with one describing it as a "stronger baseline" (Towards Interpreting Visual Information Processing in Vision-Language Models) and others situating it alongside methods like Shapley values and attention weights. While most sources frame it as a general feature attribution technique, a single paper offers a distinct perspective, describing it as a "more accurate (though more computationally expensive) approximation of causal effects" (Sparse Feature Circuits: Discovering and Editing Interpretable Causal Graphs in Language Models).
