## State of the Field

Across the provided literature, Tree-of-thought is characterized with some variation, being framed both as a "reasoning framework" and as an "evaluation procedure" used as a baseline. The prevailing description is of a method that explores multiple reasoning paths for complex problem-solving by maintaining a tree of intermediate steps. This structure allows for mechanisms like self-evaluation, lookahead, and backtracking to find more promising solution paths. One paper operationalizes this by using a "separate prompt to have the model act as a value function, rating each potential next step," where thoughts correspond to lines of code. Another source describes these thoughts more generally as "coherent language sequence[s] that serve as an intermediate step toward problem solving." The explicit exploration of different reasoning paths is noted to enable strategic decision-making. Some studies employ specific search algorithms like BFS and MCTS to navigate the tree structure.
