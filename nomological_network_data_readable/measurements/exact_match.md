## State of the Field

Across the provided literature, Exact Match (EM) is predominantly characterized as a conventional and strict evaluation metric that measures whether a model's generated output is identical to a ground-truth reference. Most definitions specify that this comparison is performed after normalization of both the predicted and reference strings, with one paper noting a prediction is correct "if and only if the normalized strings are identical" (The Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard (BFCL)). The procedure is sometimes applied to a specific part of an output, such as a "dedicated answer field". As an evaluation metric, it is typically used to calculate the percentage of correct predictions and is often reported alongside other metrics like F1 and Intersection over Union (IoU). A less common application described in the data is its use as a "correctness criterion for training data filtering" (Cascading Large Language Models for Salient Event Graph Generation). The provided data also indicates that Exact Match is used as a way to measure `String manipulation`.
