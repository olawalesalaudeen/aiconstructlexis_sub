## State of the Field

Across the surveyed literature, Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting is consistently described as an evaluation procedure or prompting method designed to elicit intermediate, step-by-step reasoning from a model before it produces a final answer. The prevailing usage of this technique is to assess or enhance the reasoning abilities of large language models, and it is explicitly used to measure constructs such as `Chain-of-thought reasoning` and `Natural language understanding`, as well as behaviors like `Emotion analysis`. The method is operationalized in several common forms, most frequently as `zero-shot` CoT, which provides no examples and often uses the instruction “Let’s think step-by-step,” and `few-shot` CoT, which includes in-context examples of reasoning. It is applied to a wide variety of tasks, from question answering and code generation to anomaly detection and grammatical error correction. While its primary function is to scaffold a model's own problem-solving, one paper notes that for certain tasks like decision-making, there is "no standard CoT pipeline," indicating some flexibility in its application. A less common framing treats it as a "judging procedure" (`LLM-CoT`) for assessing paraphrase quality. In many studies, CoT prompting serves as a baseline and is directly compared with "direct prompting" to evaluate performance gains on reasoning-heavy tasks.
