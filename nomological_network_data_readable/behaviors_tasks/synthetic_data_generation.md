## State of the Field

Across the surveyed literature, synthetic data generation is most commonly described as the process of using a language model to produce labeled examples for training or data augmentation. This approach is frequently presented as a practical solution to "mitigate the shortage of training data" or avoid the need for large, manually labeled datasets. The behavior is typically operationalized by prompting an LLM with few-shot examples, such as providing "8-shot examples from the development set" to generate new input text, or creating new question-SQL pairs to help a model understand a database schema. While most papers focus on creating training data, a few distinct applications are also described. These include generating "synthetic demonstrations" for in-context learning, sometimes under differential privacy constraints, and producing "synthetic labels" for model evaluation where an AI model acts as a judge. One paper also details a specialized use, "ghost example construction," to generate prompts that replicate a model's behavior for analytical purposes. This behavior is studied alongside `Generation diversity` and `Generalization`, and some work reports that it boosts performance on downstream tasks like `Text classification` and `Code generation`.
