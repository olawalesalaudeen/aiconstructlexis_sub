## State of the Field

Expert routing is most commonly described as the behavior of selecting and activating specific expert sub-networks within a model to process inputs. The prevailing operationalization of this behavior occurs at the token level, where a "router" or "gating network" assigns individual tokens to one or more experts, often based on similarity in the hidden space. Some work distinguishes between routing decisions made independently at each layer and those made sequentially, where one layer's assignments condition the next. A smaller body of work conceptualizes routing at a coarser granularity, such as "sequence routing," where an entire input sequence is assigned to a single expert, or "model routing," where a whole evaluation instance is directed to one of several distinct foundation models. This behavior is typically observed and analyzed through "routing scores," which, as one study notes, "facilitates mechanistic interpretability by enabling observations of fine-grained experts' routing patterns" (Monet: Mixture of Monosemantic Experts for Transformers). The stated function of this mechanism can also be to enable knowledge transfer, as in "cross-lingual routing," which allows "knowledge to propagate across languages" (Efficiently Democratizing Medical LLMs for 50 Languages via a Mixture of Language Family Experts).
