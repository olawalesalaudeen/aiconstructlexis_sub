## State of the Field

Across the provided literature, model merging is most commonly defined as the process of combining multiple, independently fine-tuned model checkpoints into a single model through weight-space operations. The stated goal is often to create an efficient multi-task model that inherits the capabilities of its components without retraining, or more generally, to produce a single "improved model" from multiple inputs. This process is described as combining models fine-tuned on "disparate tasks" to achieve multi-task proficiency. A smaller line of work defines the behavior more specifically as "LoRA merging," which involves combining multiple task-specific LoRA adapters into a unified adapter. Another variation frames model merging as a technique for continual learning, where merges are performed during the training process to preserve knowledge across different stages. The behavior is operationalized through specific tools like `mergekit7` which apply algorithms to model parameters. The performance of the resulting merged models is evaluated using benchmarks such as GLUE and the Hugging Face Open LLM Leaderboard.
