**Also known as:** Token-by-token decoding, Greedy decoding, Parallel decoding, Decoding  

## State of the Field

Across the provided literature, token decoding is most commonly described as the process of generating a sequence of tokens one at a time during model inference. This behavior is operationalized and measured by its computational cost, with papers evaluating "average per-token decoding latency" and the "average FLOPs required to decode" a sequence ("Adaptive Rank Allocation: Speeding Up Modern Transformers with RaNA Adapters"). A prevalent strategy for this process is "Greedy decoding," which involves selecting the token with the highest probability at each step and is presented as a "maximum a-posteriori-based decoding" method. Some work contrasts the sequential, one-at-a-time approach with "Parallel decoding," an extension that generates multiple tokens per step by unmasking several positions at once. A less common framing, found in "The Foundations of Tokenization...", defines decoding more abstractly as the process of mapping a token sequence back into a character string, which may be stochastic. The concepts of "token-by-token" and "parallel" decoding are specifically discussed in the context of Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs).
