## State of the Field

Across the surveyed literature, pseudo-label generation is most commonly described as a technique where a large language model acts as a 'teacher model' to generate labels for unlabeled data. This process is frequently used to expand the training set for smaller models, a practice associated with knowledge distillation. However, the specific implementation and data modality vary; some work applies this to 'unlabeled node pairs' for graph-based tasks, while other papers describe generating labels for 'unlabeled code snippets' using model confidence or a 'symbolic module'. A distinct application involves using multimodal large language models to create 'rich pseudo-labels' for images through simulated dialogues, producing 'fine-grained and diverse visual descriptions' without manual supervision. In terms of application, pseudo-label generation is operationalized to support tasks such as text classification, where LLMs generate labels for unlabeled texts via 'task-specific prompting'. The behavior is also studied in the context of zero-shot learning.
